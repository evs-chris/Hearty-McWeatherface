# Terms of Use

Anyone who successfully installs this watch face may use it or choose not to. There are no guarantees that this software will function correctly, incorrectly, or even at all. There is also no guarantee that this software will not somehow melt your watch, your arm, the polar ice caps, the gold reserves in Fort Knox, or all the cheese in Wisconsin. By using this software you agree that its developers are in no way responsible for anything related to its use that ever happened, is happening, or will happen in perpetuity, because you agree that you are using it at your own risk. That said, there's probably not a whole lot of damamge that a watch face could do.

This software is in no way vetted by a medical professional. In fact, there are probably optometrists who strongly recommend you not use it, because it has lots of tiny things to read.
