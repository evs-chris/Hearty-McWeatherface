# Hearty McWeatherface

Do you have a Fitbit Sense or Versa 3? Do You like seeing a crapload of stats in one glance? If you answered 'yes' to both of those questions, and you have pretty ok eyesight, then you might be interested in this watch face.

## This Repository

This repository contains everything needed to build the watch face using Fitbit Studio. The assets used to create the assets are in the assets directory, as one would expect. The studio directory contains a dump of the Fitbit Studio project, because I like to be able to see what horrid bit of code broke what, when, and where.

I also track changes to the watch face as published here in the CHANGELOG, and at some point in the future, I'll probably add a help site for GitHub Pages to point to from the docs. There's a lot on the face that could use more description, but the Fitbit Gallery doesn't allow for very much.
